## Reporting Issues

### You have a problem

Please be so kind as to [search](#use-the-search-luke) for any open issue already covering
your problem.

If you find one, comment on it so we can know there are more people experiencing it.

Then, you can go ahead and create an issue with as much detail as you can provide.
It should include the data gathered as indicated above, along with:

1. How to reproduce the problem
2. What the correct behavior should be
3. What the actual behavior is

Please copy to anyone relevant by mentioning their GitHub handle
(starting with `@`) in your message.

### You have a suggestion

Please be so kind as to [search](#use-the-search) for any open issue already covering
your suggestion.

If you find one, comment on it so we can know there are more people supporting it.

If not, you can go ahead and create an issue. Please copy to anyone relevant by mentioning
their GitHub handle (starting with `@`) in your message.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Consider the [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml) when writing code.

### Getting started

You should be familiar with the basics of [contributing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
and have a fork properly set up.

You MUST always create PRs with _a dedicated branch_ based on the latest upstream tree.

If you create your own PR, please make sure you do it right. Also be so kind as to reference
any issue that would be solved in the PR description body,
[for instance](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
_"Fixes #XXXX"_ for issue number XXXX.

### You have a solution

Please be so kind as to [search](#use-the-search) for any open issue already covering
your [problem](#you-have-a-problem), and any pending/merged/rejected PR covering your solution.

If the solution is already reported, try it out and +1 the pull request if the
solution works ok. On the other hand, if you think your solution is better, post
it with a reference to the other one so we can have both solutions to compare.

If not, then go ahead and submit a PR. Please copy to anyone relevant by mentioning
their GitHub handle (starting with `@`) in your message.

### You have an addition

Please be so kind as to [search](#use-the-search) for any pending, merged or rejected Pull Requests
covering or related to what you want to add.

If you find one, try it out and work with the author on a common solution.

If not, then go ahead and submit a PR. Please copy to anyone relevant by mentioning their
GitHub handle (starting with `@`) in your message.

For any extensive change, you will have to find testers to +1 your PR.

## Use the Search

GitHub offers [many search features](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-github/)
to help you check whether a similar contribution to yours already exists. Please search
before making any contribution, it avoids duplicates and eases maintenance. Trust me,
that works 90% of the time.

If all fails, your thing has probably not been reported yet, so you can go ahead
and [create an issue](#reporting-issues) or [submit a PR](#submitting-pull-requests).
